# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Required Homework

### Watching Video resources
- I was able to watch all the required videos to gain more insight on the scope of the bootcamp and the scope of the entire project we will be building.

- I implemented some of the security best practices recommended by Chirag.

### Concept and Logical diagrams
- I had issues with coming up with drawings for this aspect of the homework but I was able to get past the issues when I reached out to fellow bootcampers.

This is my own version of the concept diagram:

<br>

This reflects how I understood the project.

I was also able to recreate the Logical Architecture diagram [here](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/58f70b13-17b2-4378-977b-04a55c54451e/edit?viewport_loc=-248%2C192%2C2231%2C1253%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_33da70b3-8d0d-4a57-a006-b526045dc68e) <br>

### Install and Verify AWS CLI
- I followed the video resource and was able to get ```aws cli``` working with ```gitpod```.

- I did this by updating the ```.gitpod.yml``` file with this code block:

```
tasks:
  - name: aws-cli
    env:
      AWS_CLI_AUTO_PROMPT: on-partial
    init: |
      cd /workspace
      curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
      unzip awscliv2.zip
      sudo ./aws/install
      cd $THEIA_WORKSPACE_ROOT
```
This code ensures ```AWS CLI``` is installed anytime I set up ```gitpod```

- I was able to set up my aws credentials using the environment variable with these set of commands:

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="***********"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="**********"
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-east-1"
```
- To ensure the environment varaibles persisted on ```gitpod```, I ran these commands as well:

```
gp env AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="*************"
gp env AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="************"
gp env AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-east-1"
```

- I ran this command to verify ```AWS CLI``` was installed and configured correctly:
```
aws sts get-caller-identity
```
output:

### Enabling Billing
- Using my root account on the ```AWS Console```, on the **Billing page**, I set up my account to send out billing alerts to my email address.

### Creating a Billing Alarm
- I created a billing alarm as required using the ```AWS CLI```.
- I did this by setting up an alarm topic - **SNS topic**, first using this code:
```
 aws sns create-topic --name billing-alarm
 ```
 output:
 ![sns output](./week-0-asset/sns-topic-output.png)
 <br>

 - I also had to create a **SNS subcription** for the topic created. I also used the ```AWS CLI```
 ![sns sub](./week-0-asset/sns-subscription.png)
 <br>

 - The subcription required a confirmation via a link sent to my email.

 - I created a JSON file [alarm-config.json](https://github.com/IbeChuksVictor/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/aws/json/alarm-config.json) to define the metrics for the alarm. 
- I ran the following command to create the alarm:
```bash
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --cli-input-json file://aws/json/alarm-config.json
```

 ### Create a Budget
To create the budget, I did the following:
- On gitpod, I got my Account ID by running the following command:
```
aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text
```
- I saved the output which was my account ID as an environment variable using the first command and persisted it on ```gitpod``` using the second command.
```
export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID="459355284738"

gp env AWS_ACCOUNT_ID="459355284738"
```
- I created a [budget.json](https://github.com/IbeChuksVictor/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/aws/json/budget.json) file and a [budget-notifications-with-subscribers](https://github.com/IbeChuksVictor/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/aws/json/budget-notification-with-subscribers.json) file
- I ran the following command to create the budget:
```
aws budgets create-budget \
    --account-id $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID \
    --budget file://aws/json/budget.json \
    --notifications-with-subscribers file://aws/json/budget-notifications-with-subscribers.json
```

I did not create a second Budget because I was concerned of budget spending going over the 2 budget free limit.
